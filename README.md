# IndustryTalk02_TIS
Exclusive talk on how to succeed in the field of Computer Science

In this industry talk, two UTM alumnis share their experience and things they've learned over the years.

The talk gave me a new perspective on how to improve myself with skills that are relevant in this industry. I see
myself getting out of my comfort zone as suggested in the talk ‘Designing Success’. In the next four years, I
will continue improving, adapting and acquiring skills to be the best I can, guided by the tips I gained from this
talk and the talks I will join in the future.
Other than the technical skills, I will put more focus on enhancing my soft skills, as mentioned during the talk.
These soft skills include communication, leadership and adaptability.
